# AssaultCube-Offsets
Memory base address for the player class and its offsets to make hacks for AssaultCube

[ For educational purposes of course ]

```
DWORD PlayerEntity = 0x50F4F4;

DWORD healthOffset = 0xF8;
DWORD grenadeCount = 0x158;
DWORD playerXPosition = 0x34;
DWORD playerYPosition = 0x3c;

DWORD weaponRifleAmmo = 0x150;
DWORD weaponPistolAmmo = 0x13C
```

I will update this when I find more.
